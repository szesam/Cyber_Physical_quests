# Code Readme

For this quest we have 2 code files. The main code file named "fishtank.c" where we execute the main program. We also have a header file named "alphafonttable.h" where we store an array of alphanumeric bitmaps for each ASCII value that can be represented using the 14-segment Adafruit numeric display. 

This code was adapted from the class examples and skills that we completed before.
