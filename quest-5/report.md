## Summary
**Contributors:**

In this quest we designed a semi-autonomous crawler which has the ability for cruise control using a PID controller as well as being controlled by a user through buttons on a web page. Our crawler has a variety of sensors and devices attached to achieve a more accurate manuver. We have attached the following onto the crawler: 
    1) LIDAR Lite V3 facing front.
    2) Optical Encoder in the back right wheel. 
    3) Accelerometer on the top. 
    4) IR Range Finder facing the right side.
    5) RaspberryPi Camera facing the front. 
    6) Alphanumeric Display on the left side.
Once turned on the user must start the Buggy by pressing the START button. From here the autonomous part and the manual part can begin to take place. The crawler is programmed maintain a speed of 2 cm/sec using PID controller and the speed calculated using the Optical Encoder. We have also included an IR range sensor that aids in keeping the crawler's center course by steering it to the center when it goes lower than our setpoint of 50 cm. Our system also features obstacle avoidance with the front facing LIDAR sensor. If the LIDAR detects an obstacle within 1 meter or less, it will send a warning message to the webpage from where the user can avoid a collision through visual aid from the Raspberry Pi Camera. If any obstacle comes within 20 cm of the crawler, it will automatically stop as an emergency collision resposne.
All communications between the Crawler and the user is done via a UDP protocol and Wifi connection.

## Solution Design
Front End and UDP Protocol Communication:
For this quest we are asked to set up a web page through a web server in which a user can control the motion of the crawler. Not only do the user get to start, stop, and steer the crawler, but the page also displays data back to the user. This data includes distance traveled, calculated using an Optical Encoder. It also includes crawler speed calculated using two different devices, the previoulsy mentioned optical encoder and an ADXL343 accelerometer.
We have set up the communication between the ESP32 and the server using UDP protocol through a Wifi generated by the Loaned Router. Using UDP we send a payload that includes the sensor data and it is transmitted every one second. At the server side, we receive this message and we transfer the separated data to the web page using SocketIO. This transmission happens every one second, and therefore information in the web page is updated every one second. 
The web page features 4 buttons. START BUGGY, STOP BUGGY, STEER RIGHT, STEER LEFT. Once one of these buttons is pressed, a message is sent back to the udp client(ESP32) and the Crawler acts accordingly. 


### Crawler Build and Circuitry:

On top of the base-design crawler, we attached  a breadboard using some zipties so that it secured in place even if the crawler is moving. 
The breadboard contains the circuits connecting the
