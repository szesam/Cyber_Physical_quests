In this quest we are designing a semi-autonomous crawler which has the ability for cruise control as well as being controlled by a user through the internet.
To achieve this, we have attached the following onto the crawler: 
    1) LIDAR
    2) Encoder
    3) Accelerometer
    4) (Place for ultrasonic)
    5) PID
Once turned on, the crawler will begin to move when it detects that there are no obstacle within 20 cm of it. It will maintain a speed of 2 cm/sec using PID. If the LIDAR detects an obstacle within 1 meter, it will send a warning to the webpage. If the obstacle comes within 20 CM of the crawler, it will automatically stop and send a message to the webpage prompting the next course of action

## Solution Design

### Crawler Build and Circuitry:

On top of the base-design crawler, we attached  a breadboard using some zipties so that it secured in place even if the crawler is moving. 
The breadboard contains the circuits connecting the
